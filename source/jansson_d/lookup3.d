/*
 * lookup3.c, by Bob Jenkins, May 2006, Public Domain.
 * 
 * These are functions for producing 32-bit hashes for hash table lookup.
 * hashword(), hashlittle(), hashlittle2(), hashbig(), mix(), and final_()
 * are externally useful functions.  Routines to test the hash are included
 * if SELF_TEST is defined.  You can use this free for any purpose.  It's in
 * the public domain.  It has no warranty.
 * 
 * You probably want to use hashlittle().  hashlittle() and hashbig()
 * hash byte arrays.  hashlittle() is is faster than hashbig() on
 * little-endian machines.  Intel and AMD are little-endian machines.
 * On second thought, you probably want hashlittle2(), which is identical to
 * hashlittle() except it returns two 32-bit hashes for the price of one.
 * You could implement hashbig2() if you wanted but I haven't bothered here.
 * 
 * If you want to find a hash of, say, exactly 7 integers, do
 *   a = i1; b = i2; c = i3;
 *   mixin (mix!("a", "b", "c"));
 *   a += i4; b += i5; c += i6;
 *   mixin (mix!("a", "b", "c"));
 *   a += i7;
 *   final_(a, b, c);
 * then use c as the hash value.  If you have a variable length array of
 * 4-byte integers to hash, use hashword().  If you have a byte array (like
 * a character string), use hashlittle().  If you have several byte arrays, or
 * a mix of things, see the comments above hashlittle().
 * 
 * Why is this so big?  I read 12 bytes at a time into 3 4-byte integers,
 * then mix those integers.  This is fast (you can do a lot more thorough
 * mixing with (12 * 3) instructions on 3 integers than you can with 3 instructions
 * on 1 byte), but shoehorning those bytes into integers efficiently is messy.

 * mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.
 * 
 * This is reversible, so any information in (a, b, c) before mix() is
 * still in (a, b, c) after mix().
 * 
 * If four pairs of (a, b, c) inputs are run through mix(), or through
 * mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
 * are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
 * This was tested for:
 * * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
 *   of top bits of (a, b, c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
 *   (a, b, c).
 * * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
 *   the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
 *   is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
 *   difference.
 * * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or
 *   all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.
 * 
 * Some k values for my "a-=c; a^=rot(c, k); c+=b;" arrangement that
 * satisfy this are
 *     4  6  8 16 19  4
 *     9 15  3 18 27 15
 *    14  9  3  7 17  3
 * Well, "9 15 3 18 27 15" didn't quite get 32 bits diffing
 * for "differ" defined as + with a one-bit base and a two-bit delta.  I
 * used http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/avalanche.html to choose
 * the operations, constants, and arrangements of the variables.
 * 
 * This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of (a, b, c)
 * that fail to affect some output bits of (a, b, c), especially of a.  The
 * most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even achieve
 * avalanche in c.
 * 
 * This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
 * the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
 * direction as the goal of parallelism.  I did what I could.  Rotates
 * seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands
 * on, and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used
 * rotates.

 * hashlittle() -- hash a variable-length key into a 32-bit value
 * 
 * The best hash table sizes are powers of 2.  There is no need to do
 * mod a prime (mod is sooo slow!).  If you need less than 32 bits,
 * use a bitmask.  For example, if you need only 10 bits, do
 *   h = (h & hashmask(10));
 * In which case, the hash table should have hashsize(10) elements.
 * 
 * If you are hashing n strings cast(ubyte**)(k), do it like this:
 *   for (i = 0, h = 0; i < n; ++i) { h = hashlittle(k[i], len[i], h); }
